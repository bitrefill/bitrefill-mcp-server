# Active Context: Bitrefill MCP Server (Initialization)

## 1. Current Focus

The immediate task is to perform a code quality review of the `src/` directory, acting as a staff frontend engineer. This involves analyzing the existing structure and code (starting with `index.ts` and the directory layout) to identify areas for improvement.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** The core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are being created as they were missing. This is the first step before addressing the user's primary request.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Complete Memory Bank:** Create the `progress.md` file.
2.  **Analyze `src/`:** Begin the code review process by examining the files within the `src/` subdirectories (`constants/`, `handlers/`, `schemas/`, `services/`, `utils/`).
3.  **Provide Feedback:** Document findings and suggest improvements based on the analysis.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- The review should focus on code quality aspects relevant to a staff-level engineer: structure, maintainability, clarity, error handling, potential optimizations, adherence to best practices (TypeScript, Node.js, MCP).
- The analysis will start broadly based on file structure and `index.ts`, then delve deeper into specific modules as needed.
