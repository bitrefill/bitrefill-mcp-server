# Progress: Bitrefill MCP Server (Initialization)

## 1. What Works

- **Core Server Setup:** The basic MCP server structure is in place (`index.ts`) using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- **Stdio Transport:** Communication via standard I/O is configured.
- **Environment Loading:** `dotenv` is used to load configuration.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Top-level error handling for startup and server errors exists in `index.ts`.
- **Modular Structure:** A directory structure (`constants`, `handlers`, `schemas`, `services`, `utils`) is established.
- **Handler Registration:** A mechanism to register resource and tool handlers is present (`registerHandlers` function).

## 2. What's Left to Build/Verify

- **Detailed Implementation:** The actual logic within `handlers`, `services`, `utils`, `schemas`, and `constants` needs review.
- **API Client Implementation:** The specifics of `utils/api.ts` (e.g., library used, authentication, error handling) are unknown.
- **Schema Usage:** How schemas in `schemas/` are used for validation needs confirmation.
- **Tool/Resource Completeness:** Verify if all required tools/resources mentioned in `projectbrief.md` are implemented.
- **Testing:** No tests are apparent within the `src/` directory structure (tests exist at the root level, but their coverage of `src/` is unknown).
- **Logging Detail:** The extent and usefulness of logging via `logError` need assessment.

## 3. Current Status

- **Memory Bank Initialized:** All core Memory Bank files have been created.
- **Awaiting Code Review:** The next step is to perform the requested code quality review of the `src/` directory.

## 4. Known Issues/Risks

- **Missing Implementation Details:** The review is initially based on structure; actual code quality within modules is yet to be determined.
- **API Key Handling:** Security and proper handling of API keys passed via `.env` are crucial but not yet verified.
- **Bitrefill API Contract:** Reliance on the external Bitrefill API introduces potential for breakage if the API changes. Robust error handling is key.
